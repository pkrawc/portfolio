## Have you ever wanted to build something so stupid that it had to succeed?

Yeah, me too. Design is a business proposition, there is little personal opinion about it. Or, it should be, it's never perfect. I've spent years designing digital products and disecting others designs. What makes them work? Why that user flow? What have they chosen _not_ to do.

With coinlance I took an outlandish brief and ran with it. **Design a product for freelancers that only accepted crypto.** Who in their right mind would want to accept a form of payment that flucuated the way crypto currency did. Well, my clients, that's who. So I started at the top, what is a freelancers workflow? What apps do they use today? Where do those tools fail them and how can **Coinlance** ease that burden?

## User Research

Competitor research is _usually_ the best bang for the buck, if you have other businesses that are established in the space, it's likely that they've done the hard work of vetting their own flows against users. What you're looking to do isn't build a step by step reproduction, but create a table of the value props, calls to action, user journey and onboarding style that each one uses.
