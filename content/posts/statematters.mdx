## Background

After the 2016 election, there was a strong feeling of dread that engulfed a lot of us. A few individuals gathered around the idea of helping the average person be more involved with local politics.

State Matters was a small non-profit that had been started for this purpose, to educate and inform about local policies, bills, and elections. I learned they were looking for help building an online tool to accomplish their goals and I jumped on board.

The original idea, much pivoted from, was to be an up to date display of bills, important dates, and plain english explanations of the whole of government goings on. We wanted social interaction, a newsletter, videos, articles, and more. While we're still working towards that goal we haven't reached that yet. Surprisingly, the tech is there, but writing those articles and editing those informational videos is a **lot** of work.

I do think the tech stack that we ended up was no small part in the success that State Matters is today, and will be in the future. Dozens of people from designers to fullstack engineers have dedicated their time and brains into making statematters.org a place for info, and I'd like to thank everyone.

## Problem

## Solution

### [Next.js](http://nextjs.com/)

Next is a framework built around react. It gives developer sane solutions about routing, server rendering, static builds, api routing, and more. It's a dream to work with. Setting one up is as easy as `npx create-next-app --example [optional-example-from-next-examples]`.

The `/pages` directory is where all your routes live. `index.js` is the root of your application and a file like `pages/about.js` will automatically create a route to `/about`.

### [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) & [Styled System](https://styled-system.com)

Styling around the app was done with these two libraries. Styled components is a css-in-js library that's fast, and in my opinion has the best api. Styled system allows us to build easily themed components that have utility props baked in by default.
