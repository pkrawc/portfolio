# Micro Site for a Micro Brewery

Patrick Shaut has been involved in the beer industry for over 10 years, working at one of the most awarded brewpubs in the country and experimenting with brewing on the side. In 2018 he and few friends decided to found a business and make their foray into craft beer official. Dutchbag is a brewery focused on wild and sour ales. Pat and I have known each other almost as long as he's been brewing, and I jumped at the chance to help them build out a landing page as the storefront of their journeyman's brewery.
