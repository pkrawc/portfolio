# A High in the Sky Logistics Problem

Illinois legalized recreational cannabis consumption in 2019. While following the bill through state legislature I started to imagine products that could take advantage of this new market in intersting ways.

I'm a fan of membership clubs, they let people experience products at lower price points by buying in bulk. Wine of the month clubs seem to have hit an inflection point recently, with companeis like Winc, Williams Sonoma, and even WSJ starting a recurring delivery service.

With that in mind, I wondered what reception a cannabis club would have. A monthly delivery of curated products, with the user able to customize a box to fit their preference.

This project was a fun thought experiment, but hit a fairly critical roadblock almost immediately in Illinois. The bill that got passed, banned delivery of recreational cannabis products. Medical deliveries are okay, but seem to live in a legal grey area. Anyway this product is still on my mind and I tinker with it often enough that when it's a viable business I might try and start a regional version.
