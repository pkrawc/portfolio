# Local Politics With A Human&nbsp;Face

In late 2016, a group of people got sat down together to figure out what they could be doing for our political landscape. Trump had just narrowly won the presidential election and the time seemed rife to do everything we could to bring attention to initatives that could use help.

### People needed reminding that their state matters.

Most people think at the national level when they think about politics but activism at the state and local level has a much greater impact on individuals.

We needed to build a product to inform communities about laws passing in their own neighborhoods.

### Providing easily digestible pieces of info is something that's core to visual design and arts. We decided to use those talents to increase awareness.

The group that founded State Matters was made up of designers, artists, lobbyists and researchers. To play to our strenghts and not rely on an overtly tech heavy product, our online presence became a multi-channel approach with a content site tying all the threads together.

Because State Matters was such a distrubuted product, spanning everything from mural work to digital spaces, the first thing we focused on was building a design language. Our goal was to remain non-partisan while breaking down these pieces of legislature, so our visual language had to follow suit. Our color palette purposefully avoids anything democratic or republican. The elements of the language are blocky and familiar.

While implementing this language on our website, we used styled-system to give any technical volunteer the resources to build what they needed with minimal guidance. You can check out the open source repository for our initiative (here)[https://github.com/state-matters/web].

  trials and successes that we faced while trying to build a content center for
  a nonprofit.
