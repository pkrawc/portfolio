## Background

I joined a team in 2012 that found a way to change the background of an android phone by looking for a specific an seldom used interaction anywhere on your homescreen.

Originally called TapTap. The app promised easy customization for an often overlooked feature of a mobile phone, the background image. When I joined the team the app was serving a rotating gallery of stock images to beta users, allowing them to change the look and feel of their device by double taping on the homescreen.

## Problem

During testing and a beta release we found that users didn't engage well with just **pretty imagery**. The company was targeting ad revenue eventually so we needed seamless adoption and continued engagement of the platform to make that work.
