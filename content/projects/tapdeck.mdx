## Background

I joined a team in 2012 that found a way to change the background of an android phone by looking for a specific an seldom used interaction anywhere on your homescreen.

Originally called TapTap. The app promised easy customization for an often overlooked feature of a mobile phone, the background image. When I joined the team the app was serving a rotating gallery of stock images to beta users, allowing them to change the look and feel of their device by double taping on the homescreen.

## Problem

During testing and a beta release we found that users didn't engage well with just **pretty imagery**. The company was targeting ad revenue eventually so we needed seamless adoption and continued engagement of the platform to make that work.

## Solution

The original idea was to pull imagery from various stock image sources around the web to populate a users phone. Our onboarding asked the user to choose a number of categories that fit them, nature, cities, space, under water, etc. and we could curate a feed of backgrounds that they would enjoy.

While the first approached sometimes worked, people glance at their phones for interesting information, not a pretty picture. So we expanded the offering into more news and noteworthy categories.

Instead of just seeing images on your phones background, you could use the newly rebuilt TapDeck to discover news that mattered to you, like see a new still from a movie coming out, or the winning jumpshot from your favorite NBA team.
