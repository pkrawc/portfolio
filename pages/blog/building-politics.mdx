## Day One.

### Creating a social media platform for the greater good.

Man were there a lot of great ideas when we all got together for the first time. I joined State Matters after they had been meeting for a couple months, they were focused on getting as many people aware of local bills and state government goings-on as possible.

## Day Thirty.

### Head in the clouds, nose to the code.

## Day Ninty.

### First Release.

## Day One Hundred and Fifty.

### Making people care is hard.

## Day Three Hundred and Sixty.

### Apparently other non-profits suck too.

## Day Seven Hundred and Thirty

### We're all gonna be okay.
