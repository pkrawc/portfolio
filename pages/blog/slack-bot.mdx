At Avail, we're constantly entertaining visitors. Our office buzzer was connected to a phone number. When somone arrived at the office, they would buzz downstairs and the phone would get a call. This worked fine when we had four people at the company but as we grew having someone needing to buzz people in when they weren't in the office got annoying fast.

After doing some research, I found out you could buy a Twilio number for next to nothing, and hook it up to route the buzzer there. Once a guest is downstairs, Twilio will answer the call and allow you to interact programmatically. Our whole team is on Slack all day so notifying people there and letting employees use Slack's interactive messages to unlock the door and invite guests in seemed like a no-brainer.

## Setup

We're going to need ngrokâ€”or any other tunneling service. You can download it from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com). You won't need anything more than the free tier for this tutorial. Once you have it installed we can move on, but exposing a port to the outside world is dead simple.

```bash
ngrok http 8080

```

### Slack Web Hooks

Slack has an _incoming webhooks_ feature that will allow you to post to a unique URL and send messages to a specific channel, this is not the way to go if you're wanting to build a slack app that could be installed by many teams and used across them, but that's not what we're doing so... yeah.

You'll need to create an app at https://api.slack.com and setup a webhook into a channel that your team doesn't mind you posting a bunch of test messages to.

### Twilio

Generally, you'll need to setup a twilio number and add a webhook to your server when a call comes in.

## Serving It Up

We need to receive incoming calls from twilio and message our slack #channel. To do this, setup a simple express server with some body-parsing middleware.

```bash
npm init -y && npm i express body-parser twilio dotenv axios
```

Now that we have a space to work, lets create a server.

```js
require("dotenv").config()
const http = require("http")
const express = require("express")
const server = express()
const buzzer = require("./buzzer")

const port = process.env.PORT || 8080

server.set("port", port)

server.use(express.json())
server.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
// We're namespacing this because why stop at a door buzzer?
server.use("/buzzer", buzzer)

http.createServer(server).listen(server.get("port"))
```

## Answering The Call

We'll need to create a file called `buzzer.js`. At the top of it we'll want to instantiate our twilio client.

```js
const twilio = require("twilio")
const twilioClient = twilio(process.env.SID, process.env.AUTH_TOKEN)
const VoiceResponse = twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse
```

Once setup, twilio will send a post request to our server anytime someone rings the front door. We need to recieve that call, let them know that we're trying to flag a human down, and message a #channel on slack. Our webhook on twilio will be `/buzzer/call`.

```js
function answerCall({body: CallSid}, res) {
  const twiml = new VoiceResponse({voice: "alice"})
  // If no call id, return a bad request status.
  if (!CallSid) res.status(403).end()
  // Greet guest
  twiml.say("Welcome to Avail. One minute.")
  // Pause the phone call and continue on to message slack.
  twiml.pause({ length: 180 })
  try {
    // Ping the slack channel.
    await messageSlack({id: CallSid})
    twiml.say("No one was available. Please try again later.")
  } catch (error) {
    twiml.say("Something went wrong. Please try again.")
  } finally {
    res.type("text/xml").send(twiml.toString())
  }
}

router.post("/call", answerCall)
```

In the above we're just intercepting the call and calling `messageSlack` with the call id which is defined below.

```js
function messageSlack({ id }) {
  const slackUrl = process.env.SLACK_WEB_HOOK
  return axios.post(slackUrl, {
    text: `<!everyone>, someone is at the door.`,
    blocks: [
      {
        type: "actions",
        block_id: id,
        elements: [
          {
            type: "button",
            text: { type: "plain_text", text: "Let Them In" },
            value: "open",
          },
          {
            type: "button",
            text: { type: "plain_text", text: "Decline" },
            value: "close",
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  })
}
```

Once we've messaged slack now we wait for a reply. You can read up on [creating rich messages and incoming webhooks with slack](https://api.slack.com/). We'll also need to turn _interactivity_ on and set a resonable request url, I've chosen `/slack-response`. Slack will post the result of your slack teams action choice to this route, so we'll need to access it and take the right action.

```js
async function slackResponse(req, res) {
  const {
    payload: {
      user: { name },
      response_url,
      actions: [{ block_id, value }],
    },
  } = JSON.parse(req.body)
  const open = value === "open"
  // This is async
  twilioClient.calls(block_id).update({
    url: `${ROOT_URL}/buzzer/${value}?url=${response_url}`,
    method: "post",
  })
  res.status(200).json({
    text: open ? `Okay ${name}, I'll let them in.` : `They shall not pass`,
  })
}

router.post("/slack-response", slackResponse)
```

In the above we're parsing the response payload to build a reply and update our call downstairs to a new url that will finish the conversation and buzz the door if necessary.

The last two items we need for this shin dig are a `/buzzer/open` & `/buzzer/close`

```js
function open(req, res) {
  const twiml = new VoiceResponse({ voice: "alice" })
  twiml.say("Come on up.")
  // This might need to be switched up depending on your buzzer setup.
  twiml.play({ digits: 9 })
  res.type("text/xml").send(recording.toString())
}

function close(req, res) {
  const recording = new VoiceResponse({ voice: "alice" })
  recording.say("No one was available. Please try again later.")
  res.type("text/xml").send(recording.toString())
}

router.post("/open", open)
router.post("/close", close)
```

## Closing Thoughts

There you have it. You'll want to test this setup locally with ngrok. Once you've got a server running, tunnel it to the web and use those urls as your slack and twilio webhook inputs.
