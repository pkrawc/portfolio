![Chicago Public Transit Authority](/images/cta.webp)

I live in Chicago, and while we have an amazing public transit system (shout out to the CTA and all their amazing employees), we don't have the best apps to serve that system. Specifically I didn't want an app that would take up permissions and space on my phone, I wanted a light weight web app, so I built one. This app focuses on buses exclusively because most train platforms have much more integrated service bulletins, and google maps is amazing but I don't necessarily want to open my phone and route somewhere, I just want to know when the upcoming buses for whatever line are.

## Data

The CTA has a number of [APIs](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/) that have a _very_ generous rate allowance and encourage businesses and developers to build upon the data they collect so all that was required to get the data I was after was a quick read through and to register for an api key.

## Design

I was feeling very boxy while designing this, trying to pull inspiration from Uber and Lyft, two travel apps that are probably the most used (this was app created before March 2020). I went with hard shadows and slightly rounded corners. This is designed for mobile as most aren't holding a laptop open with 4g connection while waiting for a bus.

## Takeaways

While an overall amazing API, I wish there was search functionality in the CTA api. I would love to just pull your lat and lng and give you the buses that were around you.
