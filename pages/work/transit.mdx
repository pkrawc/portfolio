# Transit

This is a case study for a transit webapp built in 2019.

## Problem

I'm a big proponent of "You don't need an app for that". I'm really don't want to download something that I'll maybe use once every two weeks, and only in the winter. It's so much easier to just open a bookmarked browser window and with the mobile web catching up so fast to native APIs I thought a location based bus tracker was the perfect thing.

```javascript
import { hello } from "world"

function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>
}
```

## Appetite

I knew I didn't want to spend weeks on this. I also wanted to build this 50% for a design I had in my head of akin to an uber clone.

## Solution

Turns out the CTA has a pretty decent and free API. I was able to secure a key and start making requests. The first problem I ran into while building this was that there was no endpoint I could pass geocoords to and get the closest bus stop, annoying to say the least.
